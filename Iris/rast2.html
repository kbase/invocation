<h2>Introduction</h2>
<a href="http://rast.nmpdr.org/rast.cgi" target="_blank_">RAST</a> is
an automated annotation system that accepts as input a set of contigs
from a prokaryotic genome and produces as output the initial <a name="annotations32">annotations</a> needed to support researchers in
their efforts to study the genome. Since the initial publication of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18261238" name="subsystems34" target="_blank_"> The RAST Server: rapid annotations using subsystems
technology</a> in 2008, over 60,000 requests for genome <a name="annotations35">annotations</a> have been processed, and the rate
at which requests arrive has increased dramatically.
<p> As demand for ever more accurate <a name="annotations36">annotations</a>
and the number of newly-sequenced genomes increases, there is a growing
demand for "the next generation" of the RAST technology. We are in the
process of creating a new version of the architecture that will make it
completely trivial for separate groups to construct custom pipelines,
integrate new bioinformatic tools, and to make the developed pipelines
easily accessible by a large user community. This work is being done
within the DOE Knowledge Base (KBase), and initial versions are now
available via the IRIS interface. </p>
<p> To understand how the IRIS environment is used, we urge you to go
to the <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/tutorials/iris/some-basic-exercises-using-the-doe-kbase-iris-interface/" target="_blank_">IRIS site</a>, type </p>
<pre>       login <i>name</i>  [ that is, use whatever name you wish.  No password is required, but<br>                        a workspace is maintained for you under this ID ]<br>       tutorial<br></pre>
and just go through the initial tutorial. It is useful to have a small
genome available on your machine. The tutorial will show you how to
upload it to your IRIS workspace, annotate the genome, construct an
initial <a name="metabolic37">metabolic</a> model for the genome,
backfill the model, and run an initial flux-based analysis. This can
all be done within 30 minutes for a small genome (we suggest trying a <i>Buchnera</i>
genome, for example).
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Concept of the <i>Genome Typed Object</i></h2>
A <i>genomeTO</i> is just a perl data structure (a hash) that encodes
the components of what is thought of as a <i>genome annotation</i>
, along with the derived data supporting the annotation.
<p> A genomeTO is stored as a JSON-encoded string in a file within the
IRIS workspace. </p>
<p> The RAST2 Toolkit is implemented as a set of tools that transform
one genomeTO into another. That is, the typical tool takes as input a
JSON-encoded string stored in a users IRIS workspace and outputs a new
JSON-encoded string that extends in some way the contents of the input
genomeTO. </p>
<p> Pipelines are composed from the tools in the toolkit. </p>
<p> A user creates an initial genomeTO by either </p>
<ul>
  <li>uploading a file of contigs (in FASTA, Genbank or EMBL format)
for a single prokaryotic genome, which creates a genomeTO in the users
workspace, or </li>
  <li>generating a genomeTO from the contigs of a genome stored in the
KBase CS. </li>
</ul>
This second alternative is useful for creating alternative <a name="annotations38">annotations</a> for genomes that have been
integrated into the CS.
<p> The first alternative requires that you upload a FASTA-formatted
set of contigs into your work space and then run something like </p>
<pre>    fasta_to_genome 'Buchnera aphidicola str. Tuc7 (Acyrthosiphon pisum)' Bacteria 11 &lt; ../buchnera.contigs &gt; buchnera.genomeTO<br></pre>
The general form is
<pre>    fasta_to_genome scientific-name domain genetic-code &lt; contigs &gt; genomeTO<br></pre>
where the <i>domain</i> should be <i>archaea</i> or <i> bacteria,</i>,
and the <i>genetic-code</i> is usually 11 for prokaryotes (usually 4
for <i>Mycoplasmas</i>).
<p> The second alternative requires that you use something like </p>
<pre>    cs_to_genome 'kb|g.2323' &gt; buchnera.genomeTO<br></pre>
</div>
<div>
<h2> Tools for Analysis </h2>
The tools we list below represent a growing collection that can be
invoked from within IRIS.
<h2>Annotating a Genome: a Package</h2>
We provide a basic annotation package that can be invoked using
something like
<pre>  annotate_genome &lt; buchnera.genomeTO &gt; annotated.buchnera.genomeTO<br></pre>
This basic package calls genes using Glimmer, searches for tRNAs using
a tool developed by Sean Eddy, searches for rRNAs using a tool
contributed by Niels Larsen, and a number of tools developed by Gary
Olsen. It uses a kmer-based strategy for assigning functions to
protein-encoding genes. It produces a reasonably good initial
annotation fairly quickly (usually, 5-30 minutes).
<p> We mention this package first, since it offers a basic solution
against which we can evaluate new tools. That is, we will be building
new, often custom, pipelines, and we can use these base <a name="annotations39">annotations</a> to get some sense of progress. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Computing Close Genomes</h2>
One early step in annotating a genome usually involves locating a set
of well-annotated genomes that are phylogenetically very "close". As
the community begins sequencing projects in which tens of thousands of
very similar genomes are sequenced, strategies to exploit rapid
projection of <a name="annotations40">annotations</a> from
well-annotated reference genomes become more important.
<p> The current tool supported in the RAST2 Toolkit uses a 2-step
process: </p>
<ol>
  <li>First, it employs a rapid kmer-based annotation scheme that
locates sections of coding regions in the <a name="DNA41">DNA</a>,
along with functions of the encoded proteins, when they can be
identified reliably. </li>
  <li>Once a rapid initial estimate of which coding regions are present
(taking a minute or so for a typical prokaryotic genome), we can locate
regions of fairly universal genes (e.g., those encoding parts of the
translation or transcription machinery), access the corresponding
FIGfams for these genes (i.e., the <a name="protein families42">protein
families</a> that encode these genes in annotated genomes), compute
similarities between the coding regions identified in the new genome
and proteins in the FIGfams, and locate the existing genomes that
repeatedly show up as "close". </li>
</ol>
The output of this 2-step process is a list of genomes, along with
estimates (very approximate) of average identity scores expected
between the proteins encoded in the new genome and those in existing
reference genomes. The generated genomeTO will include the data from
the input genomeTO, along with a recorded list of "close genomes" and a
crude estimate of how similar each is to the new genome. Thus,
<pre>       <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#close_genomes" target="_blank">close_genomes</a> -g a.genomeTO &gt; genomeTO.with.close<br></pre>
would take as input the file <i>a.genomeTO</i> and produce as output
the file <i>genomeTO.with.close</i>, which is a JSON-encoded string
representing a structure that includes the estimate of close genomes.
This estimate is accessed via the field name <i><a name="close_genomes43"></a><a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#close_genomes" target="_blank">close_genomes</a></i>, which is a pointer to a list of
2-tuples. Each 2-tuple contains a genome ID and an estimate of average
percent identity expected between proteins in the new genome and the
corresponding proteins in the "close" genome.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Identification of tRNAs</h2>
To call the tRNAs, you can use
<pre>       call_RNAs &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.genomeTO<br></pre>
This estimate of the tRNA content is stored in the genomeTO via a field
named <i>feature</i> which gives you access to a pointer to a list of
hashes, each hash representing a single feature (i.e., features of all
types, produced by all tools, are merged into a list of these "feature
hashes". The features generated by this tool are registered via the ID
server as features of type <i>tRNA</i>.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Identification of rRNAs</h2>
To call the rRNAs, you can use
<pre>       call_RNAs &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.genomeTO<br></pre>
This estimate of the rRNA content is stored in the genomeTO via a field
named <i>feature</i> which gives you access to a pointer to a list of
hashes, each hash representing a single feature (i.e., features of all
types, produced by all tools, are merged into a list of these "feature
hashes". The features generated by this tool are registered via the ID
server as features of type <i>rRNA</i>.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Identification of Genes Related to Selenocysteine</h2>
In some genomes, machinery exists to support inclusion of unusual amino
acids. In the case of selenocysteine, you can use a tool created by
Gary Olsen to locate and annotate genes related to selenocysteine
usage:
<pre>       call_selenoproteins &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.enhanced.genomeTO<br></pre>
This tool adds features of type CDS to the list of features encoded in
the output.enhanced.genomeTO. Note that the features all include <a name="annotations44">annotations</a>, and that the fact that the
features were called by this tool is
computable from the <a name="annotations45">annotations</a>.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Identification of Genes Related to Pyrrolysine</h2>
In some genomes, machinery exists to support inclusion of unusual amino
acids. In the case of pyrrolysine, you can use a tool created by Gary
Olsen to locate and annotate genes related to pyrrolysine usage:
<pre>       call_pyrrolysoproteins &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.enhanced.genomeTO<br></pre>
This tool adds features of type CDS to the list of features encoded in
the output.enhanced.genomeTO. Note that the features all include <a name="annotations46">annotations</a>, and that the fact that the
features were called by this tool is
computable from the <a name="annotations47">annotations</a>.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Identifying Protein-encoding Genes Using Glimmer</h2>
Currently, we implement the ability to call protein-encoding using
several distinct tools and strategies. Invoking one of these tools has
the effect of creating and registering a set of CDS genes. Thus,
calling several, adds multiple distinct calls to the same 'features'
field in the genomeTO. Each such added feature includes <a name="annotations48">annotations</a>. The tool and score can be parsed
from these <a name="annotations49">annotations</a>.
<p> The basic process implemented by a <a name="pipeline50">pipeline</a>
will include generating calls from a number of tools, and then merging
the results in a completely separate step. </p>
<p> Glimmer is a very useful gene caller for prokaryotic genomes. To
get Glimmers calls, one would use </p>
<pre>       call_CDSs_by_glimmer &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.enhanced.genomeTO<br></pre>
This implements a multi-step approach where initial calls are made,
these initial calls are used to train glimmer, and then a second pass
is made to construct an estimate.
</div>
<div>
<h2>Initial Determination of Coding Regions and Probable Functions Via
Projection from Close Genomes</h2>
A second approach to calling genes is based on projecting calls from
very close genomes (if they can be located). To generate calls using
this strategy, where input.genomeTO was produced by
genomeTO_to_coding_regions, one would use:
<pre>       call_CDSs_by_projection &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.enhanced.genomeTO<br><br></pre>
call_CDSs_by_projection produces both identification of gene locations
and the functions assigned to those genes.
</div>
<div>
<h2> Merging Gene Calls </h2>
The basic strategy used by RAST2 is to use a selected set of tools to
propose potential genes. This includes tools to call different types of
genes (e.g., RNAs and protein-encoding genes), as well as different
tools to call the same types of genes (e.g., there are multiple tools
provided for proposing calls for protein-encoding genes).
<p> To produce a <i>genomeTO</i> that can be used to support
construction of <a name="metabolic51">metabolic</a> models, one should
merge these sets of proposed genes into a single, "best estimate". We
form this best estimate by looking at the entire collection of proposed
genes, deleting some that appear specious, and then keeping the
remaining set. Each gene in the merged set will include a very crude <i>score</i>
between 0 and 1 estimating confidence levels for the calls (the numbers
should be thought os as ordered, but the precise values have little
statistical justification). </p>
<p> To create a genome object that merges the gene calls use </p>
<pre>       merge_featuress &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.merged.genomeTO<br></pre>
</div>
<div><h2>Assigning Functions to Putative Protein-encoding Genes Using Kmer
Analysis</h2>
If gene calls were made by a de novo technique (like glimmer), the
functions must still be assigned. We have a tool that makes a rapid
pass using a kmer-based technology to annotate. Thus,
<pre>    assign_functions_to_CDSs &lt; input.genomeTO &gt; output.genomeTO<br></pre>
Assigning a function causes the "function" field associated with a
feature to be updated, and an annotation is added (from which the tool
and score can be extracted).
</div>
<div>
<h2>Summary</h2>
The RAST2 Toolkit being developed at Argonne National Laboratory will
offer a framework for constructing customized annotation pipelines.
This is useful for at least two purposes:
<ol>
  <li>Customized pipelines offer a means of incorporating
genus-specific algorithms like the tools for recognizing <i>Streptococcus</i>-specific
repeats. These specialized tools offer the ability to rapidly propagate
advances in tools to immediately impact the rapidly emerging
collections of genomes. </li>
  <li>The second major use of the RAST2 Toolkit will be to evaluate
alternative approaches to <a name="annotations52">annotations</a>. We
anticipate introducing a number of feature-calling algorithms, and
RAST2 offers a framework for evaluating alternative approaches. </li>
</ol>
Once the components of the RAST2 Toolkit have been built, they can be
easily pipelined. Thus, assuming you have an uploaded set of contigs,
you can use
<pre>fasta_to_genome 'Streptococcus thermophilus MN-ZLW-002' Bacteria 11 &lt; contigs &gt; genomeTO<br><br><a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#close_genomes" target="_blank">close_genomes</a>  -g genomeTO | call_RNAs | call_selenoproteins | call_CDSs_by_glimmer &gt; with.glimmer.CDSs<br><br>genomeTO_to_coding_regions &lt; with.glimmer.CDSs  &gt; with.Kmers.and.basic<br><br>call_CDSs_by_projection &lt; with.Kmers.and.basic | merge_features &gt; withmerged<br><br>genomeTO_to_feature_data &lt; withmerged | sort_by_loc -c 2 &gt; features.tab<br></pre>
