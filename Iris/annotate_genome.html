        <h1>Annotating a Genome Using KBase Tools</h1>

        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> This tutorial demonstrates how to annotate a
                set of closely related genomes using KBase tools.  We will show how to
                annotate several strains from the genus <i>Geobacter</i>.  Annotating
                multiple strains can be useful for studying differences between
                strains and identifying the pan-genome (i.e., the superset of all
                genes shared by closely related strains).  We will also demonstrate
                how to construct <a name="metabolic315">metabolic</a> models to
                clarify differences between strains.
            </p>

                This tutorial assumes you're using the IRIS web interface to access
                KBase.  However, you should also be able to follow the same procedure
                on your local computer so long as it has standard UNIX command line
                tools and the KBase software installed as described in the prerequisite
                tutorial below:

                <h2>Select a genome</h2>

                To see which <i>Geobacter</i> genomes are in the <a name="Central Store316">Central Store</a> of KBase, use the command:

                <pre>
                    <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-entity-relationship-command-scripts/#all_entities_Genome" target="_blank">all_entities_Genome</a> -f scientific_name | grep Geobacter
                </pre>

                <p>
                    You should get back a two-column table showing the available strains
                    of <i>Geobacter</i>.  The first column gives the KBase genome ID, and
                    the second column gives the strain name.  Note that it's not unusual
                    for multiple genomes to share a strain name (e.g., due to strains
                    being sampled and sequenced multiple times).  However, each will have
                    a unique genome identifier, and strains with the same name often have
                    different genome sequences.
                </p>

                <pre class = 'example'>

                    Here is the output from the above command:

                <p>
                    The genome <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> KN400 (KBase ID "kb|g.2860") is a good example to start with.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>

                <h2>Get a FASTA file of contigs from the KBase Central Store</h2>

                <p>
                    We will start by making a local copy of the contigs from
                    <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> KN400 (KBase ID "kb|g.2860")
                    using the command:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    echo 'kb|g.2860' | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#genomes_to_contigs" target="_blank">genomes_to_contigs</a> | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#contigs_to_sequences" target="_blank">contigs_to_sequences</a> &gt; g.2860.contigs
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This puts the contig sequences into a file called g.2860.contigs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that at this stage, rather than getting sequence data from the
                    KBase Central Store, we could have used any sequence data.  For
                    example, if you have sequence data for some newly sequenced microbe,
                    you could upload it to KBase through the IRIS web interface into your
                    work area.

            </div>

            <div>

                <h2>Create project subdirectories</h2>

                <p>
                    We will create subdirectories to contain each separate genome.  Let's
                    start by making subdirectory called <i>g.2860</i> where we will
                    annotate kb|g.2860:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    mkdir g.2860
                    mv g.2860.contigs g.2860
                    cd g.2860
                    ls
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The first command creates the subdirectory, the second moves our
                    contig file into the subdirectory, the third changes into the
                    subdirectory, and the last displays the contents of the subdirectory.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're using IRIS, don't use any characters in your filenames that
                    have special meaning in UNIX shells; e.g., in this case the 'kb|'
                    prefix for the genome was omitted.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>

                <h2>Create a genome object to annotate</h2>

                <p>
                    Next, use the FASTA file of contigs to create a "genome object" for our strain using the command:
                </p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
                <pre>
                    fasta_to_genome 'Geobacter sulfurreducens KN400' Bacteria 11 &lt; g.2860.contigs &gt; genome
                </pre>

                <p>
                    The genome object (in the file called "genome") contains the contigs,
                    the scientific name of the organism, the domain (we specified
                    "Bacteria"), and the genetic code for the organism (i.e., 11, which is
                    the code most commonly used with prokaryotic genomes). Use <em>ls</em>
                    to see the file, and then click on it in IRIS to see the encoded fields).
                    Note that we have named our project subdirectory g.2860, which
                    reflects the name of the genome whose contigs we copied.  The next
                    step is to re-annotate the contigs, generating a whole new genome.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Annotate a genome object</h2>

                <p>
                    We next create an initial annotation for the genome using the
                    command:
                </p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
                <pre>
                    annotate_genome &lt; genome &gt; annotated.genome
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This command causes an initial annotation to be generated (stored in
                    the file "annotated.genome").  It may take several minutes for large
                    genomes.  In IRIS, you can issue other commands while you wait, and
                    the completion message will display below the command when the
                    annotation is complete. When it finishes, you can use <em>ls</em> to
                    see the generated file, and click on it to download and view the
                    encoded <a name="annotations317">annotations</a>.  Annotated regions
                    of a genome in KBase are called "features."
                </p>

                <p>
                    An alternative method of viewing the features that were generated
                    in the annotated genome object is to use the command:
                </p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
                <pre>
                    genomeTO_to_feature_data &lt; annotated.genome &gt; features.txt
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This command produces a tab-separated table containing four columns:
                    the feature ID, location on the genome, feature type, and assigned
                    function.  Use <em>ls</em> to see the file and explore the contents.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>

                <h2>Build a metabolic reconstruction from an annotated genome</h2>

                <p>
                    <!-- the link to SEED subsystems below should go to a KBase help
                    page, and the word SEED should then be eliminated -->
                    The term "<a name="metabolic318">metabolic</a> reconstruction" as used
                    here roughly means <i>a set
                    of <a href="http://www.theseed.org/wiki/Glossary#Subsystem"
                    name="subsystems319" target="blank_">SEED subsystems</a> that are
                    annotated as present in the genome, along with the relevant variant
                    codes</i>.  A subsystem is a group of functionally related roles
                    (e.g., a metabolic pathway).
                </p>

                <p>
                    We obtain an initial <a name="metabolic320">metabolic</a>
                    reconstruction for the annotated genome using the command:
                </p>

                    (The above command is not a typo; the "TO" stands for "typed object.")
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reconstruction includes a list of functional roles for which a
                    gene was identified.  A "role" is a term indicating a function that a
                    single gene or gene product may have in a cell.  Many, but not all,
                    correspond to enzymes in metabolic pathways.  To see a list of all the
                    roles that were found in your reconstruction, use the command:

                    To see the <a name="subsystems321">subsystems</a> (along with the
                    variant codes that were assigned), use the command:

                <p>
                    You can view the contents of the "subsystems" file to see which
                    subsystems are present in the metabolic reconstuction.  Note that some
                    subsystems are listed as missing, while others are listed as present
                    in the genome.

                <h2>Find roles that might impact metabolic models</h2>

                <p>
                    How good are the <a name="annotations322">annotations</a> for your
                    newly-annotated genome? One way to assess this is to focus on the
                    roles that might impact <a name="metabolic323">metabolic</a>
                    models. We can look at the ones that were found and then compare them
                    against those that exist in a similar, manually-curated genome.  Let's
                    begin by getting the subset of the roles that might impact
                    the <a name="metabolic324">metabolic</a> models in KBase:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#all_roles_used_in_models" target="_blank">all_roles_used_in_models</a> &gt; all.roles

                </pre>

                <p>
                    The first command finds all roles used in KBase metabolic models (storing
                    them in the file "all.roles").  The second command finds the intersection
                    between all roles and the roles in the initial reconstruction (storing
                    the result in the file "roles.for.models").
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>

                <h2>Compare roles with those found in another strain</h2>

                <p>
                    It is often useful to compare the set of roles found in your
                    reconstucted genome with those from another organism; for example, We
                    might compare with a well-tested reconstruction or a manually curated
                    model for a closely related organism in order to see if we can find
                    any clear mistakes in the new reconstruction.  (This step is not
                    strictly required; if you want, you can skip to creating a model.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    As an example, we'll compare our automatically generated set of roles
                    against the set found in another <i>Geobacter</i>
                    species, <i>Geobacter metallireducens</i> GS-15 (KBase ID
                    "kb|g.9032").  Obtain the roles for that genome using the commands:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    echo 'kb|g.9032' | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#genomes_to_fids" target="_blank">genomes_to_fids</a> CDS | <a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#fids_to_roles" target="_blank">fids_to_roles</a> 2&gt; /dev/null | cut -f 3 &gt; roles.in.g.9032
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Note that the
                    command <b><a href="http://kbase.us/developer-zone/api-documentation/cdm-command-line-scripts/#fids_to_roles"
                    target="_blank">fids_to_roles</a></b> writes error messages when it
                    cannot match a fid to any roles, so the commands above redirect all
                    warning messages to /dev/null so they don't clutter up the output.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Next, we'll find potentially missing roles in our reconstruction
                    of <i>Geobacter metallireducens GS-15</i>, using the commands:
                </p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
               <pre>
                    a_and_b roles.in.g.9032 all.roles &gt; roles.for.models.g.9032
                    a_not_b roles.for.models roles.for.models.g.9032 &gt; roles.to.search.for
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This creates a file of roles in <i>Geobacter metallireducens GS-15</i>
                    that are not yet found in the <a name="annotations325">annotations</a>
                    we got back for our re-annotated version of <i>Geobacter
                    sulfurreducens KN400</i>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can manually inspect the file, to determine whether or not any
                    roles that should be there seem to be missing.  Missing roles may
                    indicate errors in the new reconstruction, or they may indicate
                    real differences in the biology of the two microbes.

                <p>
                    Now that we have an annotated genome, we can create an
                    initial <a name="metabolic326">metabolic</a> model using the command:

                <p>
                    After a minute or two, a <a name="metabolic327">metabolic</a> model
                    object is stored in a file (named "initial.model").

                <p>
                After that command completes, use <em>ls</em> and click on the

                <h2>Run flux balance analysis on the metabolic model</h2>

                <p>
                Flux balance analysis (FBA) is a mathematical approach in which our
                model is used to simulate various cellular activities, typically the
                production of biomass or metabolites from transportable nutrients. Now
                that we have a model, apply flux balance analysis in order to
                determine whether our model can grow, and to discover which pathways
                are used during growth.</p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
                <pre>
                runfba &lt; initial.model &gt; solution.html
                </pre>

                <p>
                The results from the FBA are printed in HTML in the output solution
                file. Simply run the <em>ls</em> command and click on the HTML file to
                view the solution.</p>

                <p>
                At the top of this file is a table of the parameters used to run the
                FBA. Directly below this table is another table showing the objective
                function and value. In all likelihood, your model did not grow at
                all. This is because the model is missing pathways needed for biomass
                production. When a model fails to grow, the FBA command attempst to
                diagnose the problem by identifying biomass components that cannot be
                produced. This is done by maximizing the production of each individual
                biomass component, one at a time. You can see these analysis results
                in your solution HTML file (see the metabolite production table). Note
                that some of your biomass components have no numbers in this
                table. These are the components that cannot be produced.</p>

                <p>
                Next, we will try to fix the model by adding reactions to enable
                production of these components.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Gapfill the model</h2>

                <p>
                We can run a gapfilling command on our model to automatically add
                reactions as needed to enable the production of all biomass
                components:</p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
                <pre>
                gapfill_fbamodel &lt; initial.model &gt; gapfilled.model
                </pre>

                <p>
                Depending on the size and state of the genome, this could take minutes
                to hours, but when the analysis is complete, your model will have
                additional reactions in it, reflecting the ideal solution identified
                by the gapfilling algorithm to enable growth.</p>

                <p>
                We next re-run flux balance analysis to determine the biomass
                production pathways of the organism.</p>
            </div>

            <div>

                <h2>Run flux balance analysis on the gapfilled model</h2>

                <p>
                Now that the model has been gapfilled, it should be possible to
                simulate biomass production using flux balance analysis.  Use
                the runfba command again:</p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
                <pre>
                runfba &lt; gapfilled.model &gt; solution.html
                </pre>

                <p>
                Once this command completes, use <em>ls</em> and click on the HTML
                produced by the FBA command. Your FBA solution should now include a
                nonzero objective value as well as numerous compound and reaction
                fluxes.</p>
            </div>

            <div>

                <h2>Export the model to external tools</h2>

                <p>
                Many other tools now exist that enable the analysis of
                genome-scale <a name="metabolic328">metabolic</a> models (e.g., the
                Cobra toolbox). Most of these tools read models printed in SBML
                format. Export the gapfilled model in SBML format so the model can be
                used with these tools:</p>

                <!-- needs links to API doc: -->
                <pre>
                fbamodel_to_sbml &lt; gapfilled.model &gt; gapfilled.model.sbml
                </pre>

                <p>
                After the command completes, use <em>ls</em> and select the SBML file
                for download.</p>
